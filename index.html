                I was born and raised in New Jersey and have an affinity for the Jersey Shore. Growing up I learned to play guitar and loved forming bands and learning songs with my friends. I was into professional sports but never got into playing them, so I spent most of my time with music and reading and playing video games.

                Villanova University is my alma mater. I graduated undergrad in 2010 and got an accounting job with KPMG in their Audit-Financial Services group. After 3 years and, more importantly, 3 busy seasons, I decided to call it quits and I left that position without anything else lined up. After about 4-5 weeks I interviewed with NYU Langone Medical Center for an analyst position on the Transformation team. This was a new and exciting opportunity for me rooted in change management and business process improvement. After 2.5 years on that team, my boss and I were on a very difficult project and she ended up quitting. I was moved to a financial operations team and did research/education finance work for about a year before telling my manager I needed to do something different. Luckily he allowed me to stay on the team but transitioned almostd all of my financial operations responsibilities to my colleagues and allowed me to form a new position, Data Management Specialist, where I am able to work on report automation and process improvement across our finance teams.

                It has been a great experience so far, but I am very excited to see where I end up after this boot camp is through. Coding and software development has always been an interest of mine, and I am happy I finally took the leap and started this program.
